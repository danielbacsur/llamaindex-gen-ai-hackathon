Block Buddies is an innovative project that transforms 3D worlds into linear arrays, enabling the development of autonomous agents capable of understanding and interacting with their environment in Minecraft-like settings.

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

**🌎 World Encoding**: Block Buddies uses Run-Length Encoding (RLE) and block names to compress 3D worlds into compact strings, which are then further encoded for efficiency.

**🚀 Spatial Understanding**: Agents interpret the encoded world data to comprehend their 3D environment, recognizing blocks, structures, and spatial relationships.
